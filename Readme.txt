System: Windows 10
IDE: PyCharm
Languages: Python, HTML5, CSS, SQL
Web Server: Flask
Database: SQLite3
Files: app.py, blockchain_code.py, index.html, blockchain_home.html, database.db

Steps to test the code:
1) Extract the folder from the zip file, and open that folder in pycharm.
2) Since the database is not created on its own, either double click on the database.db file or create a database using SQLite using the database.db file.
3) Run the app.py file, this should create a web server. Click on it and it will redirect you to google chrome mostly.
4) Enter any one of the credentials given below. This will take you to the home page, consisting of many options in a drop down menu on the left side.
5) Click on the last option on the drop down menu to log out.

Credentials to test for logging in:

username: user_1
password: testing123

username: user_2
password: password123

username: user_3
password: testing1234

Blockchain_code.py contains a number of function I found online and created some myself for this Banking Blockchain ERP system. There are comments in there explaining them.
